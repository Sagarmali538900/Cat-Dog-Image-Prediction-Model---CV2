# Cat–Dog Image Prediction Model

This project demonstrates how to load a trained Cat vs Dog classifier and use it to predict whether an input image is a cat or a dog.

---

## 🐱🐶 What This Notebook Does

* Loads a saved deep-learning model
* Preprocesses input images (resize, scale, reshape)
* Predicts Cat or Dog for each image
* Displays prediction results

---

## 📁 Files

* `catdogpredict23.ipynb` — notebook for prediction
* Trained model file (H5 / SavedModel) — required
* Sample images for testing

---

## 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook catdogpredict23.ipynb
```

Ensure:

* Your trained model file path is correct
* Input image folder exists

---

## 📊 Summary

A simple and practical notebook to test your Cat–Dog classifier and run predictions on new images.
